# Bible Aura Blog - GEO Implementation Guide

This guide shows how to implement the new GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) components to make Bible Aura content more AI-citation ready.

## Quick Summary

We've created 5 new components that implement your GEO strategy:

1. **AnswerSnippet** - 35-80 word answers at the top of posts
2. **FAQSchema** - QAPage/FAQPage structured data
3. **BreadcrumbSchema** - Enhanced breadcrumb structured data
4. **EnhancedBlogPost** - Full blog posts with E-E-A-T signals
5. **MicroContentPost** - Q&A style micro-content

## Component Usage Examples

### 1. Using AnswerSnippet in Existing Posts

Add this to the top of your blog post content (after the header):

```tsx
<AnswerSnippet
  question="How does AI transform Bible study?"
  shortAnswer="AI transforms Bible study by providing instant contextual insights, cross-references, and personalized study plans that adapt to your spiritual growth journey and learning style."
  scriptureCitation="Proverbs 27:17"
  supportingPoints={[
    "Instant access to biblical context and historical background",
    "Personalized study recommendations based on your interests",
    "Cross-referencing system connecting related passages"
  ]}
  relatedLink={{
    href: "/comprehensive-guide",
    text: "Read our complete Bible Aura guide"
  }}
/>
```

### 2. Using FAQ Schema

For your FAQ pages (like `/faq` or topic-specific FAQs):

```tsx
import FAQSchema from '@/components/FAQSchema'

const bibleFAQs = [
  {
    question: "Is Bible Aura theologically accurate?",
    answer: "Yes, Bible Aura maintains 95%+ theological accuracy through expert review, transparent citations, and multiple denominational perspectives."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does Bible Aura cost?",
    answer: "Bible Aura offers a generous free tier with AI chat, Bible reader, and basic features. Premium plans start at $9.99/month for unlimited access."
  }
]

// Add to your page:
<FAQSchema faqs={bibleFAQs} />
```

### 3. Enhanced Blog Post Example

Replace your current BlogPost component with EnhancedBlogPost:

```tsx
import EnhancedBlogPost from '@/components/EnhancedBlogPost'
